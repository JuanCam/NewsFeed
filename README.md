# News Feed App

You can deploy a list of news by click the 'two lines' icon in the upper left corner (Note its nice animation), also you can read the whole news by clicking the news image. The suscribe functionality needs a backend service and a DB it is only for Front End porpuse. This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
